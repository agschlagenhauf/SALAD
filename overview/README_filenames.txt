Files in data_sum (most of them available as xlsx and csv)operant_prob_sample1/operant_sample1: all subjects (n=66) and only behav data on T1/T2 (not split up on pre/rev/post)operant_sample1: same as above but removed the ones with excluded = 1 (n=56)operant_sample1_diffstay: same as above + demog data +  behav data on T1/T2 (split up into pre/rev/post as well)operant_sample1_modeling: only HC (final sample, n = 28) with demog data +  behav data on T1/T2 (split up into pre/rev/post as well)p_correct_compar_diff_loops: compares Zsuzsi's and Teresa's extraction results from behavioral data in Matlab

SALAD_bothCond_scaling_DU_tr.csv: final modeling output from cbm Modeling in Matlab, includes 2 respective win and loss: 2 alphas, 2 betas, 2 scaling factors by themselves and 2 added to beta (sc_bet_X)

zeitablauf_selection.csv: includes individual time points of cortisol measurements, subset of full sample that is not fully overlapping with our n = 28 sample1 (1B052, 1B053, 1B056, 1B057 missing) and is a transposed comment-stripped version of

Files in hierarchical/old (just to understand how hierarchical files came about):

operant_sample1_singtrial.xlsx: tab1 (relevant): 17920 rows/320 trials = 56 subjects (operant_sample1), both AD and HCtab2 (irrelevant): 8960 rowsall files beginning with "SALAD": direct output from Matlab loops
